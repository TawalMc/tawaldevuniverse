_(I'll avoid uncessary codes)_

Here I'll share a tip that I used recently (after some research ðŸ¤£) to make the existence of a (react) prop depend to the value
of another in React with TypeScript.

## The context

We have a `Menu` component which can have `MenuItem` or a custom react component as children.
Let's say the signature of `MenuItem` is like this :

```js
// MenuItem.tsx
export type MenuItemProps = {
... // some props
	label: string
}

export const MenuItem: React.FC<MenuItemProps> = ({ label }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{label}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

And the `Menu` component takes a list of `MenuItem` props and displays each `MenuItem` with its props:

```js
// Menu.tsx
export type MenuProps = {
	... // some props
	menuItemList: MenuItemProps[]
}

export const Menu: React.FC<MenuProps> = ({menuItemList}) => {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Menu</h1>
				<div>
					{
						menuItemList.map((menuItem, index) => <MenuItem key={index} {...menuItem} />)
					}
				</div>
		</div>
	)
}

```

## The problem

Now, I want that the user can display a custom component that he/she builds. Let's say a div with icon. We need `children` as props to `Menu` like this:

```js
export type MenuProps = {
	... // some props
	menuItemList: MenuItemProps[]
	children: React.ReactNode
}
```

But the problem: where do I put this children prop?

- Before the list of MenuItem ?
- After the list of MenuItem ?
- Between the list of MenuItem ? (More pains for nothing)

Yes because there will be some _devs_ who will provide these two props even if there are optionals.

I finally decide: **Only one of them will be available to use** so **"If user/dev set menuItemList array he/she cannot set children prop"**.

## The solutions

We can try to set these two props optionals then check their existence and rise an error if they are both available.
I didn't like this and didn't try to implement it. The solution I used has the same logic but more clean.

### TypeScript + never + union

_If like me, you ask yourself where we can use never, be patient, here you'll use it ðŸ¤£_

The final type will be in two parts.

#### 1st step

```js
export type MenusProps = {
  children?: null | undefined,
  menuItemList?: MenuItemProps[],
}
```

We make all of them optionals. As we want to bas our condition to the availability of `children`, we make it optionals too.

#### 2nd step

```js
export type MenusProps = {
  children: React.ReactNode,
  menuItemList?: never,
}
```

With this type, `MenuProps` can have `children` as prop but not `menuItemList`.

#### 3rd step

```js
export type MenusProps =
  | {
      children?: null | undefined,
      menuItemList?: MenuItemProps[],
    }
  | {
      children: React.ReactNode,
      menuItemList?: never,
    }
```

Now we indicate that `MenuProps` is an union of the above types. So it can have one of them but not both.
In this case, if the user of `Menu` component provides `children` as prop, he/she cannot provides again `menuItemList` as
prop and if he/she can pass nothing.

#### Bonus

The final type is

```js
export type MenusProps =
  | {
      children?: null | undefined,
      menuItemList?: MenuItemProps[],
    }
  | {
      children: Exclude<React.ReactNode, null | undefined>,
      menuItemList?: never,
    }
```

A `React.ReactNode` can be `null | undefined` and so we have two optionals properties in the second union which is not the desired behavior. So we Exclude
some values for children in this case and so we can write

```js
// Menu.tsx
export type MenusProps =
  | {
      children?: null | undefined;
      menuItemList?: MenuItemProps[];
    }
  | {
      children: Exclude<React.ReactNode, null | undefined>;
      menuItemList?: never;
}


export const Menu: React.FC<MenuProps> = ({ menuItemList }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Menu</h1>
      <div>

				{menuItemList && {menuItemList.map((menuItem, index) => (
          <MenuItem key={index} {...menuItem} />
        ))}}

				{children}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

```

Now, if you try to give a children and a menuItemList to Menu, TypeScript will rise a warning of type incompatibility.

## So

This solution may not be the best but it helps us to make some props depends to another and TypeScript can rise a warning if user didn't
respect this rule.
