## Version problems

When you follow a tutorial (JS/React/...) take care to install exactly the same package versions as those installed in the tutorial
you are following. Here is the reason.

A package that the author of the video or the tutorial has used may be updated by his `maintainers` at the time you follow the tutorial.
And maybe there are changes in this update that break the compatibility with existing code or change the return of the functions used
in the tutorial. So you will run the same commands or code without success on your side. Either you will get errors or warnings that you
have trouble understanding at first. In the best case, the author will update his tutorial or if you are using `TypeScript` some
behaviors like executing a non-existent function or using a property that is not present in an object will rise an error.

I give two examples that happened to me.

### 1st example

The tutorial exists in two versions: video and written. Here the author has handled the problem well.  
In one of the sections of the written version (which is up to date) he added the remark that a second line of code is needed if the verion of a specific package
package used is `x`. While in the video there was no such precision. I had started with the video and soon I had a problem with the execution and quickly encountered a problem at runtime and had to turn to the written version to understand the problem.

### 2nd example: children

For those who are familiar with react, you will recognize the `children` prop of react which allows you to have one or more `React Element` as "child(ren)" of another
react component, a bit like here:

```JS

// Before React 18

// main.tsx
type MainProps = {
	name?: string
}

const Main: React.FC<MainProps> = ({ name = "", children }) => {
	return (
		<>
			<h1>{name}</h1>
			<div className="mt-10">{children}</div>
		</>
	);
}

// sub.tsx
const Sub = () => {
	return (
		<Main>
			<h1> Bankai </h1>
			<p> Senbon Zakura </p>
		</Main>
	);
}
```

Long before there was no need to specify children in the props, because children was added by default to the `react components` much like the `key`
prop and the react typing (`@types/react`) was set up that way. But with version 18, you have to specify children in the props. So

```ts
// After React 18

// main.tsx
type MainProps = {
  name?: string
  children: ReactNode // MUST
}

const Main: React.FC<MainProps> = ({ name = '', children }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{name}</h1>
      <div className="mt-10">{children}</div>
    </>
  )
}

// sub.tsx
const Sub = () => {
  return (
    <Main>
      <h1> Bankai </h1>
      <p> Senbon Zakura </p>
    </Main>
  )
}
```

Now, imagine that you are following a tutorial from 2021 in 2022 where `children` was used as an implicit prop without being aware of
of this change?

**Anecdote**: I usually type `children` every time I use TS + React or TS + Next.js so when I configure new projects
I had not encountered this problem, it was once on Twitter, I noticed that there were tweets in all directions on the subject. But more
fear than harm.

## Bonus: How to install a package version

Just open the package json of the (tutorial) project then copy `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections and paste them in your project.
And run after `yarn` or `npm install`. If you want to install a specific version of a package try:

```js
yarn add package-name@version
```

or

```js
npm install package-name@version
```
